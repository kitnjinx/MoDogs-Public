Dogs with two copies of 'B' will have black fur, while dogs with two copies of 'b' will have sable fur. Dogs with one copy of each will have red fur and can pass the black or sable trait.",

Dogs that have the merle trait have a distinctive patchy look, though in this breed it only shows on black fur and other colors will carry the gene, though it will always show on a genetics test. Two merle parents will always produce a merle pup, while merle bred to a non-merle can produce a pup with or without the merle trait.",
