The 'B' allele creates sable coloration, while the 'b' allele creates primarily black coloration, leaving only tan points. Dogs with one copy of 'b' will carry the black gene and may pass it on to pups, providing the potential for black pups depending on the other parent. Dogs with two copies of 'b' will always create either black carriers or black puppies.",

Two merle parents will always produce a merle pup, while merle bred to a non-merle can produce a pup with or without the merle trait.",
