Dogs with one copy of 'b' will carry the red gene and may pass it on to pups, providing the potential for red pups depending on the other parent. Dogs with two copies of 'b' will always create either red carriers or red puppies.",

Two merle parents will always produce a merle pup, while merle bred to a non-merle can produce a pup with or without the merle trait.",
