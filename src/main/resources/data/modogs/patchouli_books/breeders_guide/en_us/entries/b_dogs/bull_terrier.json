Dogs with one copy of 'b' will carry the red trait and may pass it on to pups, providing the potential for red pups depending on the other parent. Dogs with two copies of 'b' will always create either red carriers or red puppies.",

Dogs with two copies of 'W' will have completely white fur, while dogs with two copies of 'w' will have smaller white markings. Dogs with one copy of each will have high amounts of white markings and show their base color.",
