The 'D' allele does not affect the coat's color, while the 'd' allele is a dilute that creates pale, or fawn, fur. Dogs with one copy of 'd' will carry the dilution trait and may pass it on to pups, providing the potential for diluted pups depending on the other parent. Dogs with two copies of 'd' will always create either dilute carriers or fawn puppies.",

Dogs with one copy of each will have more extensive white markings but still show their base color.",
