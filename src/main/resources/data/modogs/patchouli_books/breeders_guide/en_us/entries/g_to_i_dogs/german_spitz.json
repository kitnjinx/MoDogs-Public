      "text": "German Spitz have three genes that affect how they look. These are the B Locus, E Locus, and W Locus. The B Locus determines whether the dog has black or brown fur, while the E Locus determines if the dog has yellow fur or not. The W Locus determines if the dog's base coat, as determined by the B and E Locus, shows or if the dog's coat is white."

Dogs with one copy of 'b' will carry the brown trait and may pass it on to pups, providing the potential for brown pups depending on the other parent. Dogs with two copies of 'b' will always create either brown carriers or brown puppies.",

Dogs with one copy of 'e' will carry the red trait and may pass it on to pups, providing the potential for red pups depending on the other parent.
