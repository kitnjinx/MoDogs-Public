Dogs with one copy of 'b' will carry the white trait and may pass it on to pups, providing the potential for white pups depending on the other parent. Dogs with two copies of 'b' will always create either white carriers or white puppies.",

Dogs with two copies of the 'S' allele have traditional saddle-like black markings, while dogs with two copies of the 's' allele have completely black fur. Dogs with one copy of each have high amounts of black and only have brown on their legs. The S Locus is only visible on non-white dogs.",
