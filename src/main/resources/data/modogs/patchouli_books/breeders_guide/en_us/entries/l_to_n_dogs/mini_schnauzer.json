The 'D' allele does not affect the coat's color, while the 'd' allele is a dilute that creates lighter fur. Dogs with two copies of 'D' will have black fur, while dogs with two copies of 'b' will have gray fur with silver markings. Dogs with one copy of each will have primarily-black fur but feature silver markings.",
